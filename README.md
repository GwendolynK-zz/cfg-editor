# what is cfg_editor?
cfg_editor adds modules to .cfg files <br>
it is design to add self destruct module in cfg files, this is only helpfull is you have tac-self-destruct <br>
**this is not a mod! you put it in your Parts folder and run it onces** <br>
<br>


<br>

## How To Install:
copy the cfg_editor to your parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor.sh** <br>
<br>
you can also put in other parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS! <br>
once it is in a parts folder, just run it! it seems simple <br>
you can run it more than once, it will only add module to cfg files that dont already have it! <br>
<br>
