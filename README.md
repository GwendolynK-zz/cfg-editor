# cfg_editor
easy to run shell script for editing .cfg files for KSP
 
<br>

## How To Install:
copy the cfg_editor to your parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor_vX.X**
you can also put in other parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS!
once it is in a parts folder, just run it!
it seems simple
