# what is cfg_editor?
cfg_editor adds modules to .cfg files. <br>
It is designed to add self-destruct modules in cfg files, so this is only helpfull if you have tac-self-destruct <br>
**this is not a mod! you put it in your Parts folder and run it once** <br>
<br>

## Still not working? Just wait.
while the script sort of works, there's still some bugs.

<br>

## How To Install:
Copy the cfg_editor to your Parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor.sh** <br>
<br>
You can also put in another Parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS! <br>
Once it is in a Parts folder, just run it! It is simple. <br>
You can run it more than once; it will only add the module to cfg files that don't already have it! <br>
<br>


## Compatibility With: 
**script tested with:** raspberry pi, Linux systems, and OSX (tested on macOS High Sierra 10.13.3). <br>
**for ksp version:** should work for all version of ksp. <br>
**for Tac Self Destruct:** should work for all versions of Tac Self Destruct. <br>
