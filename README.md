# what is cfg_editor?
cfg_editor edits cfg files in your parts folder. <br>
it is design to add self destruct module in cfg files, this is only helpfull is you have tac-self-destruct <br>
**this is not a mod! you put it in your Parts folder and run it onces.** <br>
<br>

## How To Install:
copy the cfg_editor to your parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor_vX.X**
you can also put in other parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS!
once it is in a parts folder, just run it! 
it seems simple
