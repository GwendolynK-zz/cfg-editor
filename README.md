# what is cfg_editor?
cfg_editor edits cfg files in your parts folder <br>
it is design to add self destruct module in cfg files, this is only helpfull is you have tac-self-destruct <br>
**this is not a mod! you put it in your Parts folder and run it onces** <br>
<br>

## How To Install:
copy the cfg_editor to your parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor_vX.X** <br>
you can also put in other parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS! <br>
once it is in a parts folder, just run it! it seems simple <br>
<br>


## Compatibility With: 
**script tested with:** raspberry pi and NOT mac (osx High Sierra 10.13.3) <br>
**for ksp version:** as of 2018 April 24, all version of ksp should be compatibility <br>
**for Tac Self Destruct:** should work for all versions <br>
<br>
