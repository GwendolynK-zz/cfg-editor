# what is cfg_editor?
cfg_editor edits cfg files in your parts folder <br>
it is design to add self destruct module in cfg files, this is only helpfull is you have tac-self-destruct <br>
**this is not a mod! you put it in your Parts folder and run it onces** <br>
<br>

## How To Install:
copy the cfg_editor to your parts folder **your_KSP_game/Gamedata/squad/Parts/cfg_editor_vX.X.sh** <br>
<br>
**if your running on a mac, you have to use cfg_editor_osx_vX.X.sh** <br>
**ONLY RUN THE OSX SCRIPT ON MAC, OR YOU WILL BREAK YOUR CONFIG FILES!!!** <br>
<br>
**if your running linux like system, then use the cfg_editor_vX.X.sh** <br>
you can also put in other parts folder, BUT ONLY PARTS FOLDERS! <br>
once it is in a parts folder, just run it! it seems simple <br>
<br>


## Compatibility With: 
**script tested with:** raspberry pi, Linux systems and OSX (tested on macOS High Sierra 10.13.3) <br>
**for ksp version:** should work for all version of ksp <br>
**for Tac Self Destruct:** should work for all versions of Tac Self Destruct <br>
<br>

the osx script does not have a ChangeLog right now <br>
